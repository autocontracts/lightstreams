# Lightstreams White Paper

## Introduction

This white paper outlines plans by Autonomous Contracts to develop the Lightstreams network, a peer-to-peer digital publishing network for content ranging from books, magazines, music to movies. 

The Lightstreams network will enable any individual or business to publish digital content directly to consumers without the need of using traditional online intermediaries such as Amazon, Spotity or Netflix. 

Lightstreams is made possible through the new generation of Web 3.0 technology built upon blockchain and smart contract technology. This includes the award winning Permissioned Blocks protocol developed by Autonomous Contracts. 

Traditional online intermediaries provide the service channel where content can be published in order to reach global audiences via the internet. To do this, intermediaries must own and maintain vast computer hardware in order to handle the loading requirements of consumers. Computer hardware that is housed in centralised infrastructure to reach a global scale. Lightstream's disruptive technology makes the necessity of such infrastructure obsolete. Instead through a peer to peer networking model, consumers will inherently provide the infrastructure required with their own devices as they consume content.

<b>Traditional Model</b> - Distribution of digital content to consumers via intermediaries.

 For example, using only a laptop, an author publishes a title of an e-book to the Lightstreams network. A customer who purchases the title, downloads a copy directly from the author's laptop to their computer. When a second customer purchases the e-book, they download content parts of the content simultaneously from the author and the first customer's computers. The author could disconnect their laptop from the network and the e-book would continue to sell, as a third customer would download content from the first and second customers and so forth. Since the payments are executed using blockchain technology, the author can reconnect to the network at any time and collect their earnings.

The current state of digital publishing is that of an oligopoly market where only a few internet firms have a large majority of market share. As such, the incumbents are able to tightly control the distribution channel and charge high fees whilst providing a substandard service.

By using a peer-to-peer distribution model, Lightstreams will have a superior advantage over the incumbents by:
- Decreasing the publishing costs for creators, artists and authors of digital content.
- Creating a community controlled network where creators, artists and authors of digital content can benefit from its success.
- Having an open protocol that allows any entity to connect and provide new and improved channel services.

The initial goal of the Lightstreams network and the scope of this paper is the development of a publishing channel for digital books, with the particular focus on the academic and technical books. By selecting this niche market category, we believe that this will give the greatest opportunity to maximise market traction by targetting the most likely early adopters, IT and technical professionals. 

Once traction has been established in this niche market, horizontal expansion into other book categories can occur. Following this, Lightstreams will expand to other forms of digital content publishing such as music and video streaming. 

The Lightstreams network will be capable of music and video streaming via an IPFS protocol layer, which is a proven peer to peer file distribution technology for serving multiple file types.

Content on the Lightstreams network will be purchased via a Lightstream digital token (LST). Content publishers will receive LST tokens into digital wallets that can be exchanged for fiat currency. A fundraising round via the sale of LST tokens will be announce in due course in order to fund the development activities outlined in this paper.

## Problems facing Publishers when using Online Bookstores

Lightstream's initial focus will be the development of a publishing channel for digital books.

Authors and publishers of digital books currently face today the following pain points when using online bookstores for publishing and selling their works.

### High Fees 

High sales fees for using online bookstores mean that authors receive up to 50% less revenue for their books than if they were able to sell directly to their customers. 

For example a book valued at $9.99 sold on Amazon, has the following fees:

1. For a standard sale, an approximate 48% fee is charged; this comprises a 30% platform fee plus and an electronic delivery fee of $2.58.

2. For a subscription sale, an approximate 50% fee is charged. This is calculated using the subscription fee structure, where the author receives $0.00496 per page read, with a max payout of $5.00 for a 1000 page book.

### Lack of Trust in Reported Sales

Authors and publishers today have no ability to trace and verify the sales data generated by online bookstores. The lack of transparent data provenance creates a lack of trust in generated sales reports produced by the online bookstores. 

Not only limited to online bookstores, intermediaries often receive frequent complaints and in certain cases legal action has been taken against them for incorrect reporting:
- Amazon apologizes for concerns raised about Kindle Edition Normalized Page Count (KENPC) anomalies [3] 
- AgeView Press published the ebook title "Flying Solo" on Amazon's Kindle Direct via the Createspace e-store and filed a complaint about incorrect sales reporting. [2]
- Spotify settled a $20 million dispute with music publishers for the failure to report and pay licensing fees for distribution of copyright material [1].
- RootZoo sues Facebook for overcharging of advertising fees by incorrectly reporting on advertisement clicks [4].

### Inability to Direct Market

Acting as intermediaries, online bookstores control the ownership, custody and storage of customer information and sales data. Only a small subset of this data is shared with the authors and publishers, which hampers their ability to track sales and gain insights into their reader's behaviour and interests. 

The lack of customer contact information also means that authors are unable to communicate directly with their fan base for feedback, make announcements and release early drafts of their works to interested readers.

This lack of customer and sales information ultimately creates a missed marketing opportunity for authors and publishers to generate new sales.

### Fake Reviews that Impact Sales

Most online bookstores provide book review sections that are open to anyone for posting comments and reviews. There have been known cases where individuals that have not purchased or read the material have written reviews. In fact, there are third party services that can be hired with teams of writers who can write positive endorsements about certain books in order to progress them further up best selling lists. In some cause it has been known that authors themselves have written favourably about their own books and negative of others in order to create an unfair advantage. 

- In 2016, Orlando Figes, a respected history professor at Birkbeck, University of London was discovered to have posted fake reviews on Amazon lavishing high praise on his own book whilst describing other books as 'awful'. [5]

## Mission Statement

Lightstreams mission is to create a publishing network for digital content ranging from books, magazines, music to movies. A network that is owned and regulated by the community, so that creators of content can connect directly with fans in a low cost, fair and open marketplace.

## Features

### The Lightstreams Token

The lightstreams token (LST) will be an application token that is recorded on the Lightstream blockchain with the following behaviour:

1. Can be exchanged in order to access digital content.
2. Can be exchanged for fiat or cryptocurrency.
4. Can be used for voting on network proposals. Voting power is based upon number of tokens collected via sales over a specified period.

The sale of LST tokens during a fundraising event will determine the initial distribution of tokens. The number of tokens in circulation will remain fixed. 

### Complete Customer Information and Sales History

### A Direct Customer Communication Channel

A twitter like communication medium where customers who have purchased content will be able to follow content creators.

### Fair Customer Review and Feedback Channel

## Blockchain Architecture

The Lightstreams blockchain will be an Ethereum compliant network operating independently of the main Ethereum chain with the following features:

- It will be a public network such that any user can openly connent and transmit transactions to the network.
- It will have an Ethereum compliant API. 
- It will use the Permissioned Blocks protocol for transaction level privacy. 
- It will use the Tendermint protocol for achieving transaction consensus.
- It will be a global scalability network with an aimed throughput of approximately 8,000 transactions per second with a maximum network latency of 5 secs.

## Scaling to a Global Audience

Permissioned Peer to peer file sharing 

Using this technology means it is unnecessary for an intermediary to provide the infrastructure for content to be distributed to a global audience. Just as in peer to peer file sharing networks, Lightstreams will be similarly be able to scale globally via the use of IPFS, a distributed file sharing layer that is part of the Permissioned Blocks protocol.

Transaction level privacy.

This means that only certain accounts will be able to access specific information as the result of a sale of digital content. For example, the author of a digital book will be able to view certain details that have been authorised by the reader who bought their book, and the reader will only be able to view the digital content that they have bought.

## Sales Models 

There will be two different sales models for published content that will be controlled by smart contracts on the Lightstreams blockchain.

- By granting permission as a result of a direct sale between the author and reader.
- By granting permission based upon the reader being a member of a subscription based sales model.

### Direct Sales

An author will attach a version of their digital book to a direct sales contract and publish the contract at a specific LST price. The direct sales contract uses Permissioned Blocks technology to control access to the digital content. At any time the author can update the price the version of their works. The buyer will pay the most recent LST price and will access to all digital versions attached to the contract. The author will be charged the Lightstreams service fee, which will be a small percentage of the total price per book sold.

The procees of a direct sale is as follows:

<b>Token Exchange - Sale of Digital Content via Smart Contract</b> 
</p>

### Subscription Sales

An author can opt to sell their content via a subscription  sales model. Using this model, an author will earn revenue based upon a normalised price per page accessed by the reader. To utilise this model, the author attaches their digital works to a smart contract that uses Permissioned Blocks technology to control access to each page of the book. The smart contract will only permit readers to access a page that are members of a subscription contract. 

Subscription contracts will be divided into subject categories. Readers will pay a monthly LST subscription fee in order to gain access to unlimited content within the subject category controlled by the subscription contract. For any month the reader can decide to not pay the monthly subscription fee, upon which their membership to the subscription contract will be removed.

At the end of each month the total LST tokens collected for the month per subject is distributed to the authors less the Lightstreams service fee. The tokens will be divided and distributed by the ratio of pages accessed per book. If a book has more than 1000 pages, then the total number of pages for calculation purposes is capped to a 1000 pages. 

For example:

## Lightstream Marketplace

The lightstreams marketplace will give the ability for readers to search and browse for books available for sale. Readers will be able to search via book subject, author, popularity or promoted works. Upon selection of a book the reader can choose to view the content based upon a direct or subscription based purchase depending upon the author's sales model choice for the book. 

Just as any online bookstore, the marketplace will show free information to the reader to aid in order to aid their purchasing decision:

- book's font and back cover
- contents page
- index page if available
- A short blurb
- Reader reviews

A listing fee will be charged for publishing the book on the marketplace. The fee will cover the costs of reviewing uploaded content to the marketplace to ensure the quality of the marketplace is maintained.

## Network Consensus

Since the Lightstreams is a peer to peer network, consensus is required between nodes about the current state of the network. Standard Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Work(PoW) algorithm to achieve consensus, however PoW does not scale well, with transaction throughputs of ~10 transactions per second. Lightstream will instead use a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) algorithm where a set of "validator" - nodes that are explicitly allowed to create new blocks and secure the blockchain. Using a PoA algorithm such as Tendermint will allow for an order of magnitude increase in scalabilty ~10,000 transactions per second whilst also allowing for a governance model for chain maintenance and keep the block issuers accountable.

Validators do not charge gas for validating transactions. In order to protect the network from malicious smart contracts with computationally expensive operations, validators only permit transactions to be added to blocks that a destination address for contracts that have been signed as Lightstream contracts. Any transaction to that publishes a smart contract that has not been signed by a valid lightstream account will be rejected. Valid accounts for signing Lightstream contracts will be specified on by the Lightstream Foundation via the lightstreams.io website.

## Governance

Authors with the highest number of sales above a certain threshold per year and per subject category will be invited to become network validators. Network validators have the responsibility to:

1. To inspect network transactions to ensure that they are valid, and then broadcast to the rest of the network.
2. Propose new resolutions to be voted by the community via smart contracts.
3. Propose and decide by majority vote on an arbitrator for resolving transaction disputes.
