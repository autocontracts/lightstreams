# Introduction

This white paper outlines plans by Autonomous Contracts [[1]](http://autocontracts.io/) to develop the Lightstreams Network [[2]](http://lightstreams.io/), a peer-to-peer digital publishing network for content ranging from books, magazines, music, TV to movies.

The Lightstreams network is a blockchain network that enables artists to publish digital content directly to consumers, replacing existing online distribution channels. In the Lightstreams context, artists are musicians, songwriters, composers, authors, directors and any other digital content curator.

The music streaming industry is a $16Bn market[[3]](http://www.ifpi.org/global-statistics.php), on-demand video is $24Bn[[4]](https://www.statista.com/download/outlook/whiterpaper/VideoOnDemand_Outlook_1016.pdf) and the e-Books industry is $15Bn[[5]](https://www.statista.com/statistics/280249/global-e-book-revenue-by-region/). These are healthy growing markets with growth rates between 6% to 15%. However, we believe these markets are open to disruption by the intersection of peer-to-peer file sharing and blockchain technology. This combination opens up the possibility for people to buy and sell content directly between one another.

<br>
<b>Peer-to-peer sales</b> - Direct sales of digital content.
</p>
<br>

Most artists are fundamentally not happy with how the online digital content industry has evolved to leave them with a bad deal and with little control to do anything about it. 
- <b>High Fees</B> — Intermediaries take between 50 - 70% of sales revenue.
- <b>Lack of Transparency & Trust</b> — No access to raw sales figures. Intermediaries have been shown to incorrectly pay attribution and royalties fees.
- <b>Limited Access to Funding</b> — New artists find it difficult to find investment.
- <b>Fake Reviews & Impressions</b> — It is difficult to gauge who are genuine consumers of content versus bots.

The primary aims of the Lightstreams project are to:
- Redistribute the revenue proceeds in favour of artists and to sustain the ecosystem through incentivising network participants.
- Create a community controlled network where curators of digital content benefit from its success.
- Design an open protocol that allows services to be built on top of the Lightstreams protocol stack to provide the best experience for network participants.

Lightstreams will be made possible through the new generation of Web 3.0 technology[[6]](https://nextconf.eu/2016/09/next16-blockchain-will-build-web-3-0-says-jamie-burke/) built upon blockchain and smart contract technology[[7]](https://bitsonblocks.net/2016/02/01/a-gentle-introduction-to-smart-contracts/). Blockchain technology that includes the award-winning Permissioned Blocks protocol already developed by the Lightstreams team. [[8]](https://mikesmo.github.io/blog/2017/06/09/Consensus-hackathon.html) [[9]](https://github.com/autocontracts/permissioned-blocks) 

The Lightstream network will be an Ethereum-compliant network and as such will have smart contract capabilities along with a digital token known as a Photon (PHT) token. The primary utility value of the token will be through the facilitation of purchasing digital content.

# Mission Statement

Lightstreams’ mission is to give freedom back to artists so that they are ultimately in control of their content and not at the mercy of record labels, production companies, publishing houses and other intermediaries. Lightstreams is a network that is owned and regulated by the community, where artists and fans can connect in a low cost, fair and open marketplace.

# Content Publishing Problems

Lightstreams has identified the following pain points for artists selling content online. 

## High Fees

High fees for using online sales channels mean artists receive 50-70% less revenue for content than if they were able to sell directly to the consumer.
For example, a book valued at $9.99 sold on Amazon, has the following fees[[10]](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/A29FL26OKE7R7B):
1. For a standard sale, an approximate 48% fee is charged; this comprises a 30% platform fee plus and an electronic delivery fee of $2.58. [[11]](http://andrewhy.de/amazons-markup-of-digital-delivery-to-indie-authors-is-129000/)
2. For a subscription sale, an approximate 50% fee is charged. This is calculated using the subscription fee structure, where the author receives $0.00496 per page read, with a max payout of $5.00 for a 1000 page book. 

## Lack of Transparency and Trust

Intermediaries control the ownership, custody and storage of customer information and sales data they generate. Only a small subset of this data is shared with artists, which hampers their ability to track and verify sales and gain insights into their audiences behaviour and interests.

The opaque data provenance creates a lack of trust in the accuracy of the data provided and there has been in certain cases legal action over incorrect sales reporting. Also, non-standard calculation of sales between intermediaries creates confusion and frustration.

- Spotify settled a $20 million dispute with music publishers for the failure to report and pay licensing fees for distribution of copyrighted material. [[12]](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/18/business/media/spotify-reaches-settlement-with-publishers-in-licensing-dispute.html)
- RootZoo sues Facebook for overcharging of advertising fees by incorrectly reporting on advertisement clicks. [[13]](http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/rootzoo-sues-facebook-ad-click-dispute/920220)
- Amazon apologizes for concerns raised about Kindle Edition Normalized Page Count (KENPC)[[14]](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/AI3QMVN4FMTXJ) anomalies. [[15]](https://teleread.org/2016/10/08/amazon-kdp-select-authors-are-losing-page-reads-apparently-due-to-software-glitches/) 
- AgeView Press filed a complaint about incorrect sales reporting for an ebook published titled "Flying Solo" on Amazon's Kindle Direct via the Createspace e-store. [[16]]( https://jeanettevaughan.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/do-amazon-and-createspace-rip-off-indie-publishers-with-failure-to-correctly-report-sales/)

## Fake Reviews and Impressions

Most online sites provide open review sections for posting comments about content. This, however, is open to abuse by fake reviewers that are not genuine content consumers who post comments either in favour or not in favour of the material for various motives. 
For example, within the e-book industry there are third party services that can be hired to write positive endorsements about books to progress them further up best selling lists. In some cases, it has been known that authors themselves have written favourably about their books and negative of others to create an unfair advantage.

- Orlando Figes, a respected history professor at Birkbeck, University of London was discovered to have posted fake reviews on Amazon lavishing high praise on his own book whilst posting critical reviews of others. [[17]](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/16/orlando-figes-fake-amazon-reviews)

In terms audio or video content, there are bots that are used to increase the number of viewing impressions in order appear more popular and thus more attractive to advertisers to pay for advertising slots.

## Limited Access to Funding

Investment in new artists typically comes from investment channels like record labels, production companies or publishing houses. However, it can be difficult for the average artist to tap into these channels.
Artists today also utilise CrowdFunding websites for raising funds, however these are typically through the goodwill of the public through donations. 

On the investor side either the risk-reward is not right to invest in most artists or the complexity of tracking sales and distributing profits is not considered viable. 
The lack of a standardised marketplace for investing in artists generally means many simply miss out on the opportunity to pursue their dreams.

# Features

## Direct Sales and Instant Payments

The current value chain for distribution of digital content from are via online intermediaries including Amazon, Spotify, YouTube and Netflix. Lightstreams aim is to disintermediate these existing distribution models by employing a peer-to-peer network model where content curators can published directly to consumers. 

By breaking the traditional model will eliminate the high fees and via using transparent smart contracts, sales revenue can be significantly aligned in favour of producers of digital content. 

This will also mean there is no delay in artists being paid since smart contracts will distribute PHT tokens in real time their digital wallets as sales occur. The PHT tokens can then be exchanged at any time of their choosing to fiat currency.
Content producers can select the sales model from their preference of:

- <b>Pay-per-read</b> - A one-off payment to read text content per page.
- <b>Pay-per-view</b> - A one-off payment to rent video content. 
- <b>Licensed</b> - A licensed purchase of the content. 
- <b>Subscription</b> - A monthly fee for access to a category of content.
- <b>Advertisement</b> - Free access to content with revenue generated by advertising.

## In-depth Customer and Sales Data

Customer information and sales history will be recorded by smart contracts that execute on the Lightstreams blockchain network. This information will be only accessible to the owners of the smart contract and to those they granted permission via the Permissioned Blocks protocol. Permissioned Blocks utilises a decentralised storage network based upon IPFS with the additional capability that permits access to private data by authorised accounts.

All sales activity will be available to content produces and those that they have grant permission. Customer information will be an opt-in service chosen by consumers who wish to share this information with content producers.
All data recorded by smart contracts will be immediately available in real time.

## Genuine Customer Reviews and Impressions

Content producers will have the option to have their work reviewed by consumers who purchase content. Consumers will be graded on their activity using the network. This grading system will form part of a reputation score. Other users of the network can then judge the value of the reviewer's feedback based on their reputation.

Reviewers will be incentivised by PHT tokens that can awarded to them by users who enjoy the quality of their reviews. The awarding of tokens to reviewers will also feed back into the reviewer’s credibility score.
An Impression rating for the popularity of content will be on sales and an attention metric recorded by smart contracts. The attention metric will be derived from the type of content:

- <b>Text</b> - Numbers of pages downloaded or lines of text scrolled
- <b>Audio</b> - The length of time listening to a track.
- <b>Video</b> - The length of time viewing a content.

## Revenue Sharing Scheme

Content producers will have the option to allocate sales revenues to investors who have funded the creation of their works. This mechanism will be automatically governed by smart contracts such that revenue is dispersed instantly and according to the terms of the agreement negotiated between the producers and investors. 

This smart contract mechanism will provide a more efficient and transparent model over today’s accounting systems where it can take up to three months from the time content is streamed to when investors and artists are paid.

By having a more efficient and transparent allocation of revenue will open up the possibility for micro-investments. Investors can diversify their portfolios and a greater amount of artists will be able to access funding.

# Content Distribution

The current state of digital publishing is of an oligopoly market where only a few internet firms have a significant majority of market share through tightly controlling the distribution channels. As a result they are able to in turn charge disproportionate fees for this service.

In today’s online distribution model, intermediaries provide the channel for publisher distribute content to a global online audience. To reach this scale, intermediaries own and maintain large centralised computer infrastructure to handle the loading requirements of such demand.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/centralised-distribution.png">
<br>
<b>Traditional Distribution Model</b> - Distribution of digital content to consumers via centralised intermediaries.
</p>
<br>

Lightstream believes that by employing a peer-to-peer file sharing model[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_file_sharing), the existing business model can be disrupted. Instead of relying on a centralised entity to provide the infrastructure for distribution, network participants themselves will provide the necessary infrastructure to scale.

Peer-to-peer file sharing technology, like BitTorrent, has been established for some time with many global users. However, these peer-to-peer file sharing technologies tend to be used for sharing content illegally by infringing on the copyright by duplicating the material without permission of the owners. These networks also rely on the goodwill of the participants to provide digital storage and transmission bandwidth of the content. No incentive system has been put in place along with formal agreements to permit the duplication of content.

We believe that through combining smart contract technology with peer-to-peer file sharing then such an incentive system can be put in place with the express permission of the owners of the digital content.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/peer-to-peer-distribution.png">
<br>
<b>Lightstreams' Distribution Model</b> - Digital content is distributed to consumers via a peer-to-peer network that scales as demand increases.
</p>

For example, using only a laptop, an author publishes a title of an e-book to the Lightstreams network. A customer who purchases the title downloads a copy directly from the author's laptop to their computer. When a second customer purchases the e-book, they download parts of the e-book simultaneously from the author and the first customer's devices. The author could disconnect his laptop from the network, and the e-book would continue to sell, as a third customer would download content from the first and second customers and so forth. Since the payments are executed using blockchain technology, the author can reconnect to the network at any time and collect his earnings. In this example, we see the network infrastructure has scaled as demand for the e-book increases by using the customer's devices.

If demand is insufficient to support the self-sustaining distribution of content, the author can pay a small fee to a Seeding Service that will distribute the ebook until demand increases.

## Audio and Video Streaming 

The Lightstreams network is capable of music and video streaming currently via an IPFS[[19]](https://ipfs.io/) protocol layer, a proven peer-to-peer file distribution technology for streaming content. 

We are also doing research and development into employing Ethereum’s SWARM technology.
Multiplexing services like LivePeer can plug into the Lightreams technology stack to provide Transcoding services so that content can be consumed in the target format.

Lightstreams plans to develop a number of different client applications to target various devices for streaming.

1. A desktop application with full peer-to-peer streaming capabilities.
2. A browser-based library for embedding in any web page. 
3. A native (Apple and Android) application optimised for mobile devices.

# The Lightstreams Token

The Lightstreams network will consist of an independent blockchain that is Ethereum compliant. Rather than Ether as the network cryptocurrency, the Lightstreams network will operate through a Lightstreams token (PHT) that will have a unit value called a Photon.

The utility of the PHT token will be for:

1. Purchasing digital content.
2. Rewarding users for giving quality reviews of content.
3. Governance of the network, where voting power is based on sales revenue

Unlike the Ethereum network, there will be no token rewards given miners, for solving a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm[[20]](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Mining). This is because Lightstream will instead use a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm[[21]](https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-blockchain-needs-proof-of-authority-instead-of-proof-of-stake).

By employing a PoA blockchain configuration will result in a highly scalable network that has an order of magnitude in transaction throughput over using the Ethereum network, and will allow for the implementation of a unique governance system.

The sale of PHT tokens during a fundraising event will determine the initial distribution of tokens. The number of tokens in circulation will remain fixed.

# Sales Models

The following are the possible sales models that will be governed by smart contracts on the Lightstreams blockchain. The smart contracts will be controlled by a single owner who has majority rights to the content available for purchase.

In all models the owner of the contract will set the price in PHT for the content. At any time the owner can choose to adjust the price and update the version of a published material. If the owner permits, consumers purchasing the content can choose to access the most up to date version, or any previous version.

Lightstreams will charge a contract fee per smart contract transaction. 

## Pay-per-Read Model

In the Pay-per-Read model, the consumer will pay per page of text downloaded to their device. The author will set a price for the complete material and the price per page will be calculated as a proportional of the total price. 

Using the Permissioned Blocks protocol, the smart contract will only grant access to the digital content to those that have purchased the content.

The smart contract behaviour is as follows:

1. The author creates a smart contract with the price of the book and an IPFS address of the product details. 
2. The author then uploads a version of the book which is stored in their local IPFS data store and linked to the smart contract.
3. The smart contract is published the Lightstreams network.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/smart-contract-publishing-content.png">
<br>
<b>Publishing of Content</b> - Producer adds content, set price and publishes smart contract.
</p>

4. A user then purchases a copy of the book by paying the price in LST tokens set in the smart contract. This purchase is recorded in the smart contract, and a Lightstreams service fee is deducted.
5. The transaction for purchasing a copy of the book is broadcast to the Lightstreams network.
6. To retrieve a copy of the book, a request is made via the IPFS bit swap protocol for the content specified at the IPFS address stored in the smart contract. 
7. The smart contract on the author's node (or any node that has the content), verifies that the user has purchased the book. 
8. An encrypted copy of the book is sent to the user via the IPFS bit swap protocol.
9. The copy of the book is decrypted and is received by the user for reading.

<p align="center">
<img src="/images/smart-contract-consuming-content.png">
<br>
<b>Consuming of Content</b> - Consumer pays the price and retrieves a copy of the content.
</p>

## Pay-per-View Model

In the Pay-per-view model, the consumer will pay for viewing video content. This will be a similar experience to renting video content using Netflix. 

The video content will be streamed to the user's device and they will have a period that they can review the content until it no longer becomes available.

## Licensed Model

In the licensed model, the consumer pays to have access to the content for reuse on as many times as possible. This can be used for purchasing audio content such as in an iTunes model, or for purchasing text or video material that the consumer would like to use repeatedly.

## Subscription Model

In the subscription model, an owner earns revenue on a monthly bases for a proportional weight of downloads for a category their content is assigned. 

In an e-book example, the text will be normalised to price per page. Consumers that have subscribed to the category that the e-book belongs will have access to read the entire content.

Consumers who pay the subscription fee gain unlimited access to content within the category they have subscribed. At any time the consumer can decide to discontinue paying the subscription fee, upon which their membership to that category will cease.

At the end of each month the total PHT tokens collected for the month per category will be distributed to the contract owners less the Lightstreams service fee. The tokens will be divided and distributed by the ratio of pages accessed per book. If a book has more than 1000 pages, then the number of pages for calculation purposes is capped to a 1000 pages.


# Architecture

The Lightstreams blockchain will be an Ethereum compliant network operating as an independent chain with the following features:

- It will be a public network such that any user can openly connect and transmit transactions on the network.
- It will have an Ethereum compliant API that will be kept synchronised with the latest version of Ethereum.
- It will use the Permissioned Blocks protocol for the privacy of customer information.
- It will use a Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm to enable high transaction throughput and governance features.

</p>

## Discovery Service

The Lightstreams network will provide a discovery service for readers to search and browse for books and content available for sale. Readers may search via book subject, author, popularity or promoted works. Upon selection of a book, the reader can choose to view the content on a direct or subscription based purchase depending upon the sales model.

Just as any online bookstore, the discovery service will provide information about books to aid readers in their purchasing decision:

- Author details
- Front and back cover
- Contents and index pages
- Product details: Published year, ISBN, ASIN...
- A short blurb
- Reader reviews

A listing fee will be charged for publishing the book on the marketplace. The fee will be paid out to reviewers to cover the costs of reviewing content to ensure the quality of the marketplace is maintained.

## Validators

Since the Lightstreams is a peer to peer network, consensus is required between nodes to determine the valid state of the network. Standard Ethereum uses a Proof-of-Work(PoW) algorithm to achieve consensus. However, PoW does not scale well, with transaction throughputs of ~10 transactions per second. Lightstream will instead use a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) algorithm where a set of "validator" nodes that are explicitly allowed to create new blocks and secure the blockchain. Using a PoA algorithm like Tendermint[[12]](https://tendermint.com/) will allow for an order of magnitude increase in scalability ~10,000 transactions per second while also allowing for a governance model for chain maintenance and keep the block issuers accountable.

Validators do not charge a fee for validating transactions. Instead, validators are incentivised by having a stake in the successful operation of the network. Therefore, validators will be selected by those participants that maintain the highest sales volumes.

To protect the network from malicious smart contracts being published, validators will only permit Lightstreams' contracts to be added to the blockchain. The Lightstreams' contracts will be multi-signature contract templates, where both the author and the Lightstreams Foundation need to sign the contract. The Lightstreams Foundation will only sign valid smart contracts.

# Lightstreams Software Development

It is planned that key Lightstreams’ software will be released and governed by an open source license agreement. Key functional improvements will be specified via community proposals that are also voted on by the community. 

Development of features will be undertaken by both open source development and core developers of the Lightstream team. The Lightstream client will be initially developed for two target categories; desktop and mobile devices.

Desktop clients will contain the full feature set of the Lightstreams client. It is envisioned the primary use of the desktop client will be for content producers to add and manage their digital content. However, consumers may also prefer to use this client to access content.

The mobile version will be a light client version that will be optimised for tablet and mobile phone devices. Due to network bandwidth and processing constraints not all features will be available on this version.

# Governance

Authors with the highest number of sales above a certain threshold per year and per subject category will be invited to become network validators. 

Note: Authors may outsource the operational aspects of being a validator whilst retaining control and oversight. 
Network validators have the responsibility to:

1. To inspect network transactions to ensure they are valid, and then broadcast these valid transactions in blocks to the rest of the network.
2. Propose new resolutions to be voted by the community via smart contracts.
3. Propose and decide by majority vote, an arbitrator for resolving any transaction disputes.

To host a validator node, validators will need to ensure they build their node to a specified standard to ensure a minimum level of security and transaction throughput.

## Roadmap

Lightstreams has already finished its prototyping phase and plans to launch the network in Q2 2018. The following roadmap outlines the project's planned timeline:
